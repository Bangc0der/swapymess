# swapymess
This project is to design a frontend for the Mess Swap Portal.
The creation of such a platform alleviates the need for
human intervention and the general clumsiness that arises
out of the needs of those students who wish to change their
designated Dining Halls, thereby having a
systematic and effecient approach to the process.
